# IP Addressing

## Introduction
IP Addressing is a fundamental concept in networking that identifies devices on a network.

## Types of IP Addresses
1. **IPv4**: 32-bit address divided into four octets.
2. **IPv6**: 128-bit address divided into eight groups of hexadecimal digits.

## IP Address Classes
- **Class A**: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
- **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
- **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
- **Class D**: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (Multicast)
- **Class E**: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (Reserved)

## Public vs. Private IP Addresses
- **Public IP**: Addressable over the internet.
- **Private IP**: Used within local networks.

### Private vs. Public Addresses
- **Private IP Ranges**:
  - `10.0.0.0/8`
  - `172.16.0.0/12`
  - `192.168.0.0/16`
- **Public IP Addresses**: Assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and are globally unique.

## Conclusion
Understanding IP addressing is crucial for configuring and troubleshooting network devices.
