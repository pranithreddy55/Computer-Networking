# OSI Model

## Introduction
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a framework for understanding network interactions.

## Layers
1. **Physical Layer**: Transmits raw bit streams over a physical medium.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Provides node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
3. **Network Layer**: Routes packets between devices across networks.
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transfer and flow control.
5. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions and controls dialogues between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data formats and encrypts/decrypts data.
7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services to end-user applications.

## Conclusion
The OSI Model helps in understanding and troubleshooting network interactions and protocols.
